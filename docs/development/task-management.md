# Task Management with Task Master

## Overview

MonsterBox uses Task Master for comprehensive project management and development workflow coordination. Task Master integrates seamlessly with the existing MkDocs documentation system to provide a unified development experience.

## What is Task Master?

Task Master is an AI-powered task management system that helps coordinate development work across the MonsterBox platform. It provides:

- **Intelligent Task Generation** from Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
- **Dependency Management** to ensure proper development sequencing
- **Complexity Analysis** to help with effort estimation and planning
- **Status Tracking** for all development activities
- **Integration** with existing MonsterBox documentation and workflows

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Task Organization**
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Tasks can have subtasks for detailed breakdown
- **Priority Levels**: High, Medium, Low priority classification
- **Status Management**: Pending, In-Progress, Done, Deferred, Cancelled
- **Dependency Tracking**: Automatic dependency resolution and blocking detection

### ðŸ“Š **Project Insights**
- **Complexity Scoring**: AI-powered complexity analysis (1-10 scale)
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time completion percentages and statistics
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Automatic detection of blocking dependencies
- **Effort Estimation**: Recommended subtask counts based on complexity

### ðŸ”„ **Workflow Integration**
- **MkDocs Coordination**: Seamless integration with existing documentation
- **Development Process**: Task-driven development workflows
- **Automated Updates**: Documentation updates when tasks change
- **Cross-referencing**: Links between tasks and related documentation

## Getting Started

### For New Team Members
1. Review the [Task Workflows](task-workflows.md) guide
2. Understand the [Development Process](development-process.md)
3. Read the [Task Master Guide](taskmaster-guide.md) for detailed usage

### For Existing Developers
- Tasks are managed through the AI assistant interface
- All task updates are automatically reflected in documentation
- Use task-driven development for better coordination

## Integration with MonsterBox

Task Master is designed to complement, not replace, the existing MonsterBox documentation:

- **Setup Guides**: Reference existing animatronic and SSH setup documentation
- **API Documentation**: Coordinate with existing API testing and validation
- **Security**: Align with existing MCP and security documentation
- **Character Management**: Work with existing character sheets and configurations

## Next Steps

1. Complete Task Master integration with MkDocs
2. Establish task-driven development workflows
3. Train team on Task Master usage
4. Implement automated documentation updates
5. Expand task management to cover all MonsterBox development areas
