# 🚀 Augment Code Deployment Checklist - MonsterBox

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Status
- [x] GitHub repository ready: https://github.com/arwpc/MonsterBox
- [x] Three feature branches created and pushed
- [x] Environment variables configured in .env
- [x] Task Master AI configured and operational
- [x] Implementation packages prepared
- [x] Augment Code account created and logged in

## 🎯 Current Step: Platform Navigation & Repository Connection

### What to Look For in Augment Code Interface:
1. **Main Dashboard/Projects Area**
   - Look for "Dashboard", "Projects", or "Repositories" navigation
   - Try URLs: `/dashboard`, `/projects`, `/repositories`

2. **Repository Connection Options**
   - "Connect Repository" or "Add Repository" button
   - GitHub integration settings
   - Repository import/sync options

3. **Agent Management Section**
   - "Agents", "Remote Agents", or "Workers" menu
   - Agent deployment or configuration options
   - Project assignment capabilities

## 📋 Deployment Sequence (Once Platform Access is Established)

### Phase 1: Repository Connection
1. Connect GitHub repository: `https://github.com/arwpc/MonsterBox`
2. Configure branch access permissions
3. Verify repository sync and file access

### Phase 2: Agent Deployment (Priority Order)

#### 🔐 Agent 1: Security Specialist
- **Target Branch**: `feature/secure-remote-access-system`
- **Package**: `remote-agent-security-package.md`
- **Task**: Implement JWT Auth + RBAC (Task 11)
- **Priority**: HIGH

#### 🧪 Agent 2: Testing Specialist  
- **Target Branch**: `feature/comprehensive-testing-suite`
- **Package**: `remote-agent-testing-package.md`
- **Task**: Comprehensive Testing Suite (Task 15)
- **Priority**: HIGH

#### 📊 Agent 3: MCP Specialist
- **Target Branch**: `feature/enhanced-mcp-log-collection`
- **Package**: `remote-agent-mcp-package.md`
- **Task**: Enhanced MCP Log Collection (Task 4)
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

### Phase 3: Monitoring Setup
1. Configure progress tracking
2. Set up commit monitoring
3. Establish communication channels

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Week 1 Targets:
- [ ] All three agents deployed and active
- [ ] Initial commits visible on feature branches
- [ ] Task Master integration confirmed

### Week 2-3 Targets:
- [ ] Core implementations completed
- [ ] Integration testing passed
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Week 4 Targets:
- [ ] Pull requests created and reviewed
- [ ] Features merged to main branch
- [ ] Task Master tasks marked complete

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Repository Connection Fails:
1. Check GitHub permissions and access tokens
2. Verify repository visibility (public/private settings)
3. Ensure Augment Code has necessary OAuth permissions

### If Agent Deployment Fails:
1. Verify branch exists and is accessible
2. Check package file format and content
3. Confirm environment variables are properly set

### If Progress Monitoring Issues:
1. Check commit history on feature branches
2. Verify Task Master integration
3. Monitor agent status in Augment Code dashboard

## 📞 Next Actions Required

1. **Navigate to main Augment Code interface**
2. **Locate repository connection options**
3. **Connect MonsterBox GitHub repository**
4. **Deploy first agent (Security Specialist)**
5. **Monitor initial progress and provide feedback**

---

**Status**: Ready for platform connection and agent deployment
**Estimated Time to Complete**: 30 minutes setup + 2-3 weeks implementation
**Expected Outcome**: Three parallel remote agents implementing core MonsterBox features
