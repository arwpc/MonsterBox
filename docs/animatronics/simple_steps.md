## 2. Simple Steps

In MonsterBox, **Steps** are individual actions that can be performed by an animatronic character. Each Step may involve:
- Movement (using linear actuators, servos, motors)
- Playing sounds (including ElevenLabs AI voices)
- Triggering lights or other effects

Steps can be configured to run **serially** (one after the other) or **concurrently** (at the same time as the next step). For example, you can have a servo move while a sound plays, or trigger multiple actions together for synchronized effects.
