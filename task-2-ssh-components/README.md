# Task #2: SSH Connection Manager Components

## 🎯 Agent Beta Progress

I've completed the SSH Connection Manager implementation for Task #2. These components are ready to integrate with the Express backend structure that Agent Alpha is creating in Task #1.

## 📁 Components Created

### Core Services
- `services/sshConnectionManager.ts` - Main SSH connection management with pooling and retry logic
- `services/animatronicService.ts` - High-level animatronic operations service
- `routes/animatronicRoutes.ts` - Express API routes for animatronic management
- `types/ssh.d.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
- `tests/sshConnectionManager.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite

## 🔧 Dependencies Added
- `node-ssh@13.1.0` - SSH client library
- `@types/node-ssh` - TypeScript definitions

## 🚀 Integration Plan

Once Agent Alpha completes the Express backend structure:

1. **Move components to proper locations**:
   ```bash
   mv task-2-ssh-components/services/* src/services/
   mv task-2-ssh-components/routes/* src/routes/
   mv task-2-ssh-components/types/* src/types/
   mv task-2-ssh-components/tests/* tests/
   ```

2. **Integrate routes with Express app**:
   ```typescript
   import animatronicRoutes from './routes/animatronicRoutes';
   app.use('/api/animatronics', animatronicRoutes);
   ```

3. **Add to health check endpoint**:
   ```typescript
   import { animatronicService } from './services/animatronicService';
   
   // In health check:
   const sshStatus = await animatronicService.testConnectivity();
   ```

## ✅ Features Implemented

### SSH Connection Management
- ✅ Connection pooling for efficient resource usage
- ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ Health monitoring for all animatronic systems
- ✅ Environment-based credential management
- ✅ Event-driven architecture for real-time updates

### Animatronic Systems Supported
- ✅ **Orlok** (192.168.8.120) - Vampire animatronic
- ✅ **Coffin** (192.168.8.140) - Coffin-based system
- ✅ **Pumpkinhead** (192.168.1.101) - Currently offline

### API Endpoints Ready
- `GET /api/animatronics` - List all systems
- `GET /api/animatronics/status` - Get all statuses
- `GET /api/animatronics/:id` - Get specific system
- `POST /api/animatronics/:id/command` - Execute commands
- `GET /api/animatronics/:id/logs` - Get logs (app/system)
- `POST /api/animatronics/:id/restart` - Restart system
- `POST /api/animatronics/:id/shutdown` - Shutdown system
- `GET /api/animatronics/:id/test` - Test connectivity
- `GET /api/animatronics/test/all` - Test all systems
- `GET /api/animatronics/:id/commands` - Command history
- `GET /api/animatronics/commands/all` - Global command history

### Testing
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite with mocked SSH connections
- ✅ Unit tests for all major functionality
- ✅ Integration test scenarios
- ✅ Error handling and retry logic tests

## 🤝 Coordination with Agent Alpha

I'm monitoring the progress on Task #1 and will integrate these components as soon as the Express backend structure is ready. The SSH manager is designed to work seamlessly with the TypeScript/Express setup being created.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Wait for Agent Alpha to complete backend structure
2. Integrate SSH components into the Express app
3. Test end-to-end functionality
4. Create pull request for Task #2
5. Merge both tasks for complete foundation

**Task #2 SSH Manager is ready for integration! 🚀**
