# Remote Agent Status - MonsterBox Project

## Previous Remote Agents - CLOSED ‚úÖ

Three remote agents were previously configured for cloud access setup and task planning. These agents have been successfully closed out after completing their setup phase.

## Current Status Summary

### Overall Project Progress:
- **Total Tasks**: 15
- **Completed**: 0 (0%)
- **In Progress**: 0 (0%)
- **Pending**: 15 (100%)

### Subtask Progress:
- **Total Subtasks**: 0
- **Completed**: 0 (0%)
- **In Progress**: 0 (0%)
- **Pending**: 0 (0%)

## Closed Remote Agents (Setup Phase Complete)

### üß™ Remote Agent 3: Testing & Quality Assurance Specialist
**Status**: CLOSED - Setup phase completed for cloud access

**Completed Setup Tasks**:
- ‚úÖ Cloud access configuration verified
- ‚úÖ Testing framework analysis completed
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline assessment finished
- ‚úÖ Ready for handoff to new parallel agents

**Final Status**: Successfully configured cloud access and completed testing analysis. No active development work performed.

## Task Dependencies & Coordination

### Critical Path Analysis:
1. **Authentication System** (Agent 1) ‚Üí Required for monitoring dashboard security
2. **Log Collection Protocol** (Agent 2) ‚Üí Foundation for analysis and monitoring
3. **Test Coverage Analysis** (Agent 3) ‚Üí Baseline for all testing improvements

### Integration Points:
- Agent 1's JWT system will secure Agent 2's monitoring dashboard
- Agent 3's testing framework will validate work from Agents 1 & 2
- All agents must maintain compatibility with existing MonsterBox infrastructure

## Monitoring & Communication

### Progress Tracking:
```bash
# Check all in-progress tasks
task-master get-tasks --status in-progress --with-subtasks

# View specific agent progress
task-master get-task --id 11  # Security Agent
task-master get-task --id 4   # Monitoring Agent  
task-master get-task --id 15  # Testing Agent

# Update subtask progress
task-master update-subtask --id 11.1 --prompt "Progress update message"
```

### Daily Standup Format:
Each agent should provide:
1. **Yesterday**: What was completed
2. **Today**: Current focus and goals
3. **Blockers**: Any dependencies or issues
4. **Integration**: Coordination needs with other agents

## Resource Access

### Key Directories:
- **Authentication**: `/routes/`, `/data/characters.json`, `app.js`
- **Logging**: `/log/`, `/mcp-servers/`, `/scripts/logger.js`
- **Testing**: `/tests/`, `package.json`, `/scripts/test-*.js`

### Documentation:
- **Project Docs**: `/docs/`
- **API Reference**: `/docs/api/`
- **Task Management**: `/.taskmaster/`

### Target Systems:
- **Operational RPis**: Orlok (192.168.8.120), Coffin (192.168.8.140)
- **Development**: Windows workstation (C:\Users\arwpe\CodeBase\MonsterBox-1)
- **Excluded**: Pumpkinhead (192.168.1.101) - not operational

## Success Metrics

### Week 1 Goals:
- [ ] JWT Authentication Architecture document completed
- [ ] MCP Log Collection Protocol specification finished
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage analysis report generated

### Week 2 Goals:
- [ ] JWT middleware implementation started
- [ ] Enhanced log collector server deployed
- [ ] Unit test framework improvements implemented

### Week 3 Goals:
- [ ] RBAC system functional
- [ ] Automated log analysis system operational
- [ ] Integration test suite running

### Week 4 Goals:
- [ ] MFA implementation completed
- [ ] Real-time monitoring dashboard live
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configured and operational

## Emergency Procedures

### If Agent Becomes Blocked:
1. Update subtask with blocker details
2. Reassign critical path items if necessary
3. Coordinate with other agents for alternative approaches

### If Integration Issues Arise:
1. Schedule immediate coordination meeting
2. Review dependency chains
3. Adjust timelines and priorities as needed

### Escalation Path:
1. Task Master system updates
2. Project documentation updates
3. Direct communication with project lead
