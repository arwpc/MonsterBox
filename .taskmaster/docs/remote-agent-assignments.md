# Remote Agent Assignments - MonsterBox Project

## Overview
Three remote agents have been assigned to work on critical MonsterBox platform tasks in parallel. Each agent has specialized focus areas and specific subtasks to complete.

## Remote Agent 1: Security & Authentication Specialist

**Primary Responsibility**: Implement Secure Remote Access System (Task 11)

### Assigned Subtasks (In Progress):
- **11.1**: Design JWT Authentication Architecture
- **11.2**: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Framework  
- **11.3**: Integrate JWT Authentication with Existing SSH Infrastructure
- **11.5**: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

### Current Focus:
Starting with JWT Authentication Architecture design. Must review existing MonsterBox authentication in app.js and routes, focusing on integration with existing express-session middleware. Design should support the three animatronic systems (Orlok 192.168.8.120, Coffin 192.168.8.140, Pumpkinhead 192.168.1.101) and consider existing SSH credentials stored in character JSON files.

### Key Deliverables:
1. Authentication architecture document with sequence diagrams
2. JWT middleware implementation plan
3. Key rotation and management strategy
4. Token revocation mechanism for compromised credentials

## Remote Agent 2: Monitoring & Logging Specialist

**Primary Responsibility**: Implement MCP Log Collection System (Task 4)

### Assigned Subtasks (In Progress):
- **4.1**: Design MCP Log Collection Protocol
- **4.2**: Implement MCP Server Log Collection Components
- **4.4**: Implement Automated Log Analysis System
- **4.5**: Create Real-time Monitoring Dashboard

### Current Focus:
Starting with MCP Log Collection Protocol design. Must review existing log collection in /log directory and mcp-servers/log-collector-server.js. Analyze current Winston logging setup in scripts/logger.js. Design should enhance existing Sematext integration and work with the three operational RPi systems (Orlok, Coffin).

### Key Deliverables:
1. Protocol specification document with message formats and authentication
2. Enhanced log collector server implementation
3. Automated log analysis system with pattern recognition
4. Real-time monitoring dashboard with customizable alerts

## Remote Agent 3: Testing & Quality Assurance Specialist

**Primary Responsibility**: Implement Comprehensive Testing Suite (Task 15)

### Assigned Subtasks (In Progress):
- **15.1**: Analyze current test coverage
- **15.2**: Enhance unit test framework
- **15.3**: Implement integration test suite
- **15.5**: Configure continuous integration pipeline

### Current Focus:
Starting with analyzing current test coverage. Must review existing test suite in /tests directory including Mocha setup, API tests, and GPIO hardware tests. Examine package.json test scripts and current test coverage. Focus on existing test structure with characterRoutes.test.js, partRoutes.test.js, sceneRoutes.test.js, etc.

### Key Deliverables:
1. Comprehensive coverage report with detailed metrics
2. Enhanced unit test framework with better mocking capabilities
3. Integration test suite for component interactions
4. Continuous integration pipeline configuration

---

## Coordination Guidelines

### Communication Protocol:
- Each agent should update their assigned subtasks with progress reports
- Use the task management system to track completion status
- Document any blockers or dependencies discovered during work

### Priority Order:
1. **Agent 1**: Architecture document → JWT middleware → RBAC implementation → MFA integration
2. **Agent 2**: Protocol specification → Server enhancement → Analysis system → Dashboard
3. **Agent 3**: Coverage analysis → Framework enhancement → Integration tests → CI pipeline

### Integration Points:
- Agent 1's authentication system will be used by Agent 2's monitoring dashboard
- Agent 3's testing framework will validate work from both Agent 1 and Agent 2
- All agents should consider the existing MonsterBox infrastructure and maintain backward compatibility

### Expected Timeline:
- **Week 1**: Complete primary deliverables (architecture docs, protocol specs, coverage analysis)
- **Week 2**: Implement core functionality (JWT middleware, server enhancements, test framework)
- **Week 3**: Integration and testing of all components
- **Week 4**: Documentation and final validation

## Status Tracking

Use the Task Master system to track progress:
```bash
# Check overall progress
task-master get-tasks --with-subtasks

# Update subtask status
task-master set-status --id 11.1 --status done

# Add progress notes
task-master update-subtask --id 11.1 --prompt "Completed architecture document"
```

## Resources

### Key Files to Review:
- **Authentication**: app.js, routes/, data/characters.json
- **Logging**: /log/, mcp-servers/, scripts/logger.js, scripts/test-mcp-*.js
- **Testing**: /tests/, package.json, scripts/

### Documentation:
- Project documentation in /docs/
- API documentation in /docs/api/
- Character configurations in /data/

### Environment:
- Development workstation: Windows (C:\Users\arwpe\CodeBase\MonsterBox-1)
- Target RPi systems: Orlok (192.168.8.120), Coffin (192.168.8.140)
- Excluded system: Pumpkinhead (192.168.1.101) - not operational
