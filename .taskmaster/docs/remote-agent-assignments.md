# Remote Agent Assignments - MonsterBox Project

## Overview
Two new remote agents have been assigned to work on foundational MonsterBox platform tasks in parallel. These agents will work simultaneously on Tasks #1 and #2 with automatic code merging.

## Remote Agent Alpha: Backend Foundation Specialist

**Primary Responsibility**: Initialize Node.js/Express Backend (Task 1)

### Current Assignment (In Progress):
- **Task ID**: 1
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Branch**: feature/task-1-backend-init
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: None (foundation task)

- Implement connection timeout handling
- Integration tests with mock SSH connections

## Automated Parallel Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Parallel Development (0-3 hours)
1. **Agent Alpha** starts immediately on Task #1 (Backend Foundation)
2. **Agent Beta** starts immediately on Task #2 (SSH Manager)
3. Both agents work in parallel on separate branches
4. No dependencies between agents during development phase

### Phase 2: Integration & Merge (3-4 hours)
1. **Agent Alpha** completes Task #1 and creates PR
2. **Agent Alpha** PR gets automatically merged to main
3. **Agent Beta** rebases feature/task-2-ssh-manager on updated main
4. **Agent Beta** integrates SSH manager with Alpha's backend structure
5. **Agent Beta** completes Task #2 and creates PR
6. **Agent Beta** PR gets automatically merged after tests pass

### Phase 3: Validation (4-5 hours)
1. Automated integration tests run on merged code
2. Both tasks marked as completed in Task Master
3. Foundation ready for Task #3 (Character Configuration System)

## Merge Strategy & Conflict Resolution

### Automatic Merge Process:
- **No Manual Intervention Required**
- Agents work on separate modules with minimal overlap
- Agent Beta adapts to Agent Alpha's architecture
- Automated testing ensures compatibility
- PRs auto-merge after CI passes

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ Both tasks completed successfully
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Code merged to main branch
- ✅ No manual intervention required
- ✅ MonsterBox backend foundation ready

## Agent Communication Protocol

### Status Updates:
- Agents report progress every 30 minutes via commit messages
- PR descriptions include detailed task completion status
- Conventional commit format for automated processing

### Coordination Points:
- Agent Beta monitors Agent Alpha's progress
- Agent Beta adapts SSH manager to Alpha's architecture
- Both agents ensure TypeScript compatibility
- Automated dependency management

## Expected Timeline

**Hour 0-1**: Both agents start parallel development
**Hour 1-2**: Agent Alpha completes basic Express setup
**Hour 2-3**: Agent Alpha finalizes backend, Agent Beta continues SSH work
**Hour 3-4**: Agent Alpha PR merged, Agent Beta integrates and completes
**Hour 4-5**: Agent Beta PR merged, integration testing complete

## Success Metrics

After successful completion:
- ✅ MonsterBox backend infrastructure operational
- ✅ SSH connectivity to animatronic systems functional
- ✅ TypeScript development environment ready
- ✅ Testing framework in place
- ✅ Ready for Task #3 (Character Configuration System)
- ✅ Zero manual intervention required

### Current Focus:
Starting with JWT Authentication Architecture design. Must review existing MonsterBox authentication in app.js and routes, focusing on integration with existing express-session middleware. Design should support the three animatronic systems (Orlok 192.168.8.120, Coffin 192.168.8.140, Pumpkinhead 192.168.1.101) and consider existing SSH credentials stored in character JSON files.

### Key Deliverables:
1. Authentication architecture document with sequence diagrams
2. JWT middleware implementation plan
3. Key rotation and management strategy
4. Token revocation mechanism for compromised credentials

## Remote Agent 2: Monitoring & Logging Specialist

**Primary Responsibility**: Implement MCP Log Collection System (Task 4)

### Assigned Subtasks (In Progress):
- **4.1**: Design MCP Log Collection Protocol
- **4.2**: Implement MCP Server Log Collection Components
- **4.4**: Implement Automated Log Analysis System
- **4.5**: Create Real-time Monitoring Dashboard

### Current Focus:
Starting with MCP Log Collection Protocol design. Must review existing log collection in /log directory and mcp-servers/log-collector-server.js. Analyze current Winston logging setup in scripts/logger.js. Design should enhance existing Sematext integration and work with the three operational RPi systems (Orlok, Coffin).

### Key Deliverables:
1. Protocol specification document with message formats and authentication
2. Enhanced log collector server implementation
3. Automated log analysis system with pattern recognition
4. Real-time monitoring dashboard with customizable alerts

## Remote Agent 3: Testing & Quality Assurance Specialist

**Primary Responsibility**: Implement Comprehensive Testing Suite (Task 15)

### Assigned Subtasks (In Progress):
- **15.1**: Analyze current test coverage
- **15.2**: Enhance unit test framework
- **15.3**: Implement integration test suite
- **15.5**: Configure continuous integration pipeline

### Current Focus:
Starting with analyzing current test coverage. Must review existing test suite in /tests directory including Mocha setup, API tests, and GPIO hardware tests. Examine package.json test scripts and current test coverage. Focus on existing test structure with characterRoutes.test.js, partRoutes.test.js, sceneRoutes.test.js, etc.

### Key Deliverables:
1. Comprehensive coverage report with detailed metrics
2. Enhanced unit test framework with better mocking capabilities
3. Integration test suite for component interactions
4. Continuous integration pipeline configuration

---

## Coordination Guidelines

### Communication Protocol:
- Each agent should update their assigned subtasks with progress reports
- Use the task management system to track completion status
- Document any blockers or dependencies discovered during work

### Priority Order:
1. **Agent 1**: Architecture document → JWT middleware → RBAC implementation → MFA integration
2. **Agent 2**: Protocol specification → Server enhancement → Analysis system → Dashboard
3. **Agent 3**: Coverage analysis → Framework enhancement → Integration tests → CI pipeline

### Integration Points:
- Agent 1's authentication system will be used by Agent 2's monitoring dashboard
- Agent 3's testing framework will validate work from both Agent 1 and Agent 2
- All agents should consider the existing MonsterBox infrastructure and maintain backward compatibility

### Expected Timeline:
- **Week 1**: Complete primary deliverables (architecture docs, protocol specs, coverage analysis)
- **Week 2**: Implement core functionality (JWT middleware, server enhancements, test framework)
- **Week 3**: Integration and testing of all components
- **Week 4**: Documentation and final validation

## Status Tracking

Use the Task Master system to track progress:
```bash
# Check overall progress
task-master get-tasks --with-subtasks

# Update subtask status
task-master set-status --id 11.1 --status done

# Add progress notes
task-master update-subtask --id 11.1 --prompt "Completed architecture document"
```
