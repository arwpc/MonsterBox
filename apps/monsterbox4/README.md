- **Template-based creation** with prebuilt options (Bend Elbow, Rotate Head, etc.)
- **Safety enforcement** with calibration data and angle clamping
- **Real-time execution** with hardware integration

### 🏗️ **Clean Architecture**
- **Single Raspberry Pi 4B** per animatronic (self-contained)
- **No WebSocket complexity** - direct hardware control
- **Preserves all existing Python hardware scripts** (unchanged)
- **Bootstrap 5 UI** with dark theme support

### 🔧 **Hardware Integration**
- **11 Part types supported**: servo, motor, actuator, light, LED, sensor, microphone, speaker, webcam, head tracking
- **Thin hardware service layer** wrapping existing Python functionality
- **Calibration system** with safety limits
- **Local-only media streaming**

## 👥 Characters Management

MonsterBox 4.0 lets you manage multiple characters and pick which one is active. The active character is used throughout the app for parts and poses.

- Manage at Setup → Characters (http://localhost:3000/setup/characters)
- Current selection is shown in the navbar dropdown and can be changed from any page
- Persisted in data/characters.json; current selection is also stored in app config

Endpoints:
- GET /setup/characters/api/characters → list characters
- GET /setup/characters/api/characters/:id → get one character
- POST /setup/characters/api/characters { name } → create character
- PUT /setup/characters/api/characters/:id { name? } → update character
- DELETE /setup/characters/api/characters/:id → delete character
- GET /setup/characters/api/current → current selected id
- POST /setup/characters/api/select { id } → set current character


### Characters API Examples

```bash
# List characters
curl -s http://localhost:3000/setup/characters/api/characters | jq

# Get one character
curl -s http://localhost:3000/setup/characters/api/characters/1 | jq

  -d '{"name":"Nosferatu"}' | jq

# Create character (validation error: empty name -> 400)
curl -i -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/setup/characters/api/characters \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}'
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
# Body: { "success": false, "error": "Name is required" }

# Update character name (success)

# Body: { "success": false, "error": "Name is required" }

# Get current selection
curl -s http://localhost:3000/setup/characters/api/current | jq

# Set current selection
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/setup/characters/api/select \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"id":1}' | jq

# Attempt to delete the currently selected character -> 400
curl -i -s -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/setup/characters/api/characters/1
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
# Body: { "success": false, "error": "Cannot delete the currently selected character" }
```

## 📦 Data Path Convention

- Default data lives inside the app: `apps/monsterbox4/data/*.json`
- Characters file default: `apps/monsterbox4/data/characters.json`
- You can override the data folder via `apps/monsterbox4/config/app-config.json`:
  - `dataPath` is resolved relative to the app root (`apps/monsterbox4`), not the working directory
  - Examples:
    - `"data"` → `apps/monsterbox4/data/`
    - `"../../data"` → repository-level `data/` (i.e., `apps/monsterbox4/../../data`)
- Selected character is persisted in `config/app-config.json` (`selectedCharacter`), not in `characters.json`.
- The app no longer attempts to use paths like `/home/remote/data/characters.json`.

## 🎭 Using Poses

### Creating Poses

#### From Templates (Recommended)
1. Go to **Setup → Poses**
2. Click **Create Pose**
3. Select **From Template** tab
4. Choose template (Bend Elbow, Head Movement)
5. Select option (Half Bend, Look Forward, etc.)
6. Choose target part
7. Click **Create Pose**

#### Quick Template Creation
In the Templates panel, click any option button to instantly create a pose with the first available servo part.

### Executing Poses

#### Live Dashboard
- Go to **Live Mode**
- Click any pose button to execute immediately
- View execution status and results

#### API
```bash
# Execute pose by ID
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/poses/1/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{}"
```

### Pose Templates

#### Elbow Templates
- **Slight Bend** (20°)
- **Half Bend** (45°)
- **Full Bend** (90°)
- **Extend Fully** (0°)

#### Head Templates
- **Look Forward** (stop/neutral)
- **Random Movement** (subtle wiggle pattern)
- **Full Rotation** (360° continuous)

## 🔧 Hardware Configuration

### Servo Calibration
Poses use calibration data from `data/servo_calibrations.json` to ensure safe operation:

```json
{
  "30": {
    "part_id": 30,
    "part_name": "Orloks Elbow",
    "servo_type": "standard",
    "positions": {
      "min": { "pulse_us": 1000, "angle": -90 },
      "max": { "pulse_us": 2000, "angle": 90 },
      "neutral": { "pulse_us": 1500, "angle": 0 }
    }
  }
}
```

### Safety Features
- **Angle clamping** to calibrated min/max ranges
- **Pulse width validation**
- **Timeout protection** on hardware commands
- **Graceful fallback** to simulation mode

## 🌐 API Reference

## 🧪 Testing

Important: The Mocha tests call the running HTTP server at http://localhost:3000. Start the server in a separate terminal before running tests.

```bash
# Terminal 1: start the server
cd apps/monsterbox4
npm start

# Terminal 2: run tests against the running server
cd apps/monsterbox4
npm run test:unit
```

Tip: After making server-side code changes, restart the server before re-running tests.


```bash
# Run all Mocha unit/integration tests (fast)
npm run test:unit

# Run all Playwright UI tests
npm run test:ui

# Headed UI tests (visible browser)
npm run test:ui-headed

# Everything (unit + UI)
npm run test:all
```

## � Hardware Part Testing (Per‑Type)

MonsterBox 4.0 provides CRUD for Parts and a unified test endpoint for exercising hardware functionality per part type.

- Endpoint: `POST /setup/parts/api/parts/:id/test`
- Pass an explicit `action` and optional `params` for per‑type testing; if omitted, a sensible default action is chosen
- Actions are routed through the Hardware Service and, where available, call Python wrappers for real hardware

Example: test a servo by moving to a small angle

````bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/setup/parts/api/parts/19/test \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"action":"moveToAngle","params":{"angleDeg":15}}' | jq
````

Example: test an LED by setting brightness

````bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/setup/parts/api/parts/7/test \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"action":"setBrightness","params":{"brightness":50}}' | jq
````

Current controller coverage (apps/monsterbox4/services/hardwareService):
- servo: real hardware via Python wrappers (exec.js → python_wrappers/servo_cli.py)
- pca9685: interface available; currently simulated (can be wired to hardware)
- motor, linear_actuator, light, led, sensor, motion_sensor, webcam, microphone, speaker, head_tracking: simulated responses today; ready for wiring to wrappers or the Hardware Abstraction Layer under `scripts/hardware/`

Recommended UI behavior on Setup → Parts:
- Each part row exposes a compact “Test” drawer with per‑type controls:
  - Servo: angle slider; rotate cw/ccw; stop
  - Motor: direction, speed, duration
  - Linear actuator: extend/retract with speed/distance
  - Light: on/off/toggle
  - LED: brightness slider; blink; fade
  - Sensor: on‑demand Read; Calibrate (min/max)
  - Motion sensor: Read (motion detected true/false)
  - Microphone: record N ms; get level
  - Speaker: play file; set volume; stop
  - Webcam: capture still; start/stop local stream
  - Head tracking: start/stop; get position
- POST the selected `action` + `params` to `/setup/parts/api/parts/:id/test` and show structured results
- For Sensor/Motion Sensor “live read”, poll the test endpoint every 0.5–1s for a short window and display values

Implementation note: You can reuse the existing Python Hardware Abstraction Layer in `scripts/hardware/…` by adding thin CLIs under `apps/monsterbox4/python_wrappers/` and calling them via `exec.runWrapper()` (similar to servo). This keeps the single‑node design (no websockets) while leveraging proven code.

## 🗺️ Remaining Work & Next Steps

- Live Mode → Quick Poses execution
  - Replace alert() with POST `/poses/:id/execute`; show spinner/status + error banner
  - Add unit tests and a Playwright smoke test for a successful execution
- Scenes MVP
  - Implement scene model and CRUD, scene editor UI, and playback that sequences poses via poseEngine
  - Add unit tests and a Playwright test to create + run a simple scene
- Parts per‑type Test UI
  - Add drawers/modals with controls per part type (see above), wire to `/setup/parts/api/parts/:id/test`
  - Add polling UI for Sensor/Motion Sensor “read”
  - Add unit tests for each action route and Playwright checks for one action per type
- Hardware wiring beyond servo
  - Implement Python wrappers (or call HAL) for motor, linear_actuator, light, led, sensor, motion_sensor, microphone, speaker, webcam, head_tracking
  - Keep result shape consistent with current controller responses
- Calibration
  - Wire Calibration page to read/update `data/servo_calibrations.json` through an API with validation and tests
- CI/CD
  - GitHub Actions: install deps; run unit tests; install Playwright browsers (webkit; optionally firefox); run UI tests headless; upload Playwright report on failure
- Dependency hygiene
  - Review Dependabot alerts; apply safe upgrades; re‑run tests
- Deployment
  - Add systemd/PM2 service, healthcheck route, and smoke scripts
  - Document ARM64 constraints (no Chromium), use WebKit/Firefox
- Optional: Playwright on Firefox in CI and a UI consistency sweep for dark theme

Constraints to honor
- ES5 syntax in client scripts
- Single‑node, no websockets required for the main app
- ARM64 environment (no Chrome/Chromium)

## �🔄 Migration from Legacy MonsterBox

MonsterBox 4.0 is designed to run alongside the legacy system initially:

1. **Data Compatibility**: Uses existing `data/` files (parts.json, servo_calibrations.json, etc.)
2. **Hardware Scripts**: Reuses all existing Python hardware scripts without modification
3. **Character Support**: Maintains character-specific configurations
4. **Gradual Migration**: Can be deployed per-character as needed

## 🎯 Design Principles

### Single Node Architecture
- **One RPi per character** - no distributed complexity
- **Local hardware control** - no WebSocket services
- **Self-contained operation** - no external dependencies

### Safety First
- **Calibration enforcement** on all movements
- **Safe angle clamping** prevents hardware damage
- **Timeout protection** prevents runaway commands
- **Graceful degradation** with simulation mode

### Developer Experience
- **Clean code structure** with clear separation of concerns
- **Comprehensive error handling** with meaningful messages
- **Extensive logging** for debugging
- **Simple deployment** with single command startup
